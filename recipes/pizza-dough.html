        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Make tasty and authentic pizza dough with yeast easily with this recipe.</p>
        <p>Estimated time: 1 ½ - 2 hours, where the fermentation process is ½ - 1 hours.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>25 g yeast</li>
            <li>2.5 dl water</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons oil</li>
            <li>0.5 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>7-8 dl flour</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Crumble the yeast into a bowl.</li>
            <li>Heat the water to 37 degrees Celsius and pour some of the water over the yeast and stir until the yeast is completely dissolved in the water.</li>
            <li>Add the rest of the water, oil and salt and stir.</li>
            <li>Add the wheat flour a little at a time - feel free to use a stand mixer or electric mixer with dough hooks and run until it becomes a nice dough. Take enough flour to make the dough good and release the rim of the bowl.</li>
            <li>Let rise under a cloth for ½ - 1 hour until the dough has doubled in size.</li>
            <li>Put the dough on a floured surface and knead it until smooth.</li>
            <li>Roll out the dough into the shape you want and place on a baking sheet with parchment paper or in pizza pans.</li>
        </ol>
